# EscapingTitanic
It's a group project short and funny game made with Python


About the Project: This is our first group project consisting of a mini escape game. The goal is to build a text-based escape game that is interactive and fun. Four students were given about two weeks to complete a given basis of the game and enhance and expand it.

Methodology: The game is developed entirely in Python, utilizing fundamental concepts. Players make choices and navigate through the game by responding to prompts and challenges presented in the console.

Project Structure: This project is built in a Jupyter Notebook(also some part in Google Colab) but can easily be converted into a .py file to enhance gameplay.

Improvements on the game: The storyline was adjusted to the Titanic, a mini-game was added using dictionaries, some functions and methods, and also some visual enhancements were made.

Conclusion: The knowledge learnt in the first three weeks of the boot camp helped us understand the given code and to enhance it.

Enjoy playing the game!!!
